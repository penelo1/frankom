        <h2>Things About Myself</h2>
        <p>By day, I'm a professional cloud-whisperer, coaxing digital storms into harmonious symphonies of data. My evenings are reserved for competitive ferret-juggling, a surprisingly demanding sport. My demographic? Let's just say I exist in the liminal space between a sentient houseplant and a rogue AI. My income is paid in rare, vintage dial-up modem sounds, and my highest degree is a doctorate in applied interpretive dance for garden gnomes</p>

        <p>My name is Vivien I am from Melbourne and I have previously completed a Cert IV in Cyber Security, this webpage is specifically designed for my COS10005 Class  </p>

        <p><strong>Description of my hometown:</strong> My hometown is a mobile dimension, shifting locations every Tuesday at 3:17 PM. Think of it as a pop-up city for misplaced socks and philosophical squirrels.</p>

        <p><strong>Great achievements:</strong>  
            I once won a staring contest with a black hole. I invented a language spoken entirely in interpretive eyebrow movements. And I successfully negotiated a peace treaty between rival factions of sentient cheese graters. It was a tense week. Achieving so much in such a short time is exhausting. ðŸ˜Œ

        <h2>Favourite Books, Music, Films, or Games</h2>
        <p>To be honest, I rarely read these days, watch movies, or play games. The only music I listen to is jazz while studying and TikTok songs while doomscrolling.</p>
        
        <p>But when I do have time, I like to read poetry. There's this one children's book called <em>Big Panda and Tiny Dragon</em>â€”Iâ€™d recommend reading it.</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy very typical low-stress games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Tiny Glade</em>, <em>Sun Haven</em>, etc.</p>

        <p>These images are screenshots I personally captured while playing Tiny Glade. All in-game assets and designs are the property of the game developers.</p>
