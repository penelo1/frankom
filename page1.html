        <h2>Cat Care Tips</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the best cat care tips I’ve learned while taking care of Jiji:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always keep fresh water available—cats love to drink, but sometimes they need a little encouragement!</li>
            <li>Regular playtime is essential for keeping them active and healthy.</li>
            <li>Make sure they have a quiet, safe space to retreat to when they want some alone time.</li>
        </ul>
